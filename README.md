DisnixOS
========
DisnixOS is a distributed infrastructure deployment extension for Disnix.
Disnix's responsibility is to deploy distributable components (i.e. services)
into a network of machines. However, the underlying system configurations of
these machines (the infrastructure) also need to be deployed and upgraded.

DisnixOS provides complementary infrastructure deployment using [NixOS](http://nixos.org/nixos),
a Linux distribution that allows entire system configurations to be deployed with
the Nix package manager from a single declarative specification.

Optionally, it can use [NixOps](http://github.com/nixos/nixops), a NixOS-based
cloud deployment tool to perform infrastructure deployment. NixOps supports
automatic instantiation and provision of VM instances.

Prerequisites
=============
In order to build Disnix from source code, the following packages are required:

* [Disnix](http://github.com/svanderburg/disnix)
* [NixOps](http://github.com/nixos/nixops), if it is desired to use NixOps' infrastructure deployment facilities

When building directly from a Git clone, you also need:

* [help2man](https://www.gnu.org/software/help2man)
* [doclifter](http://www.catb.org/esr/doclifter)

These dependencies can be acquired with the Nix package manager, your host
system's package manager or be compiled from sources. Consult the documentation
of your distribution or the corresponding packages for more information.

Installation
============
DisnixOS is a typical autotools based package which can be compiled and installed
by running the following commands in a shell session:

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

When building from the Git repository, you should run the bootstrap script
first:

```bash
$ ./bootstrap
```

For more information about using the autotools setup or for customizing the
configuration, take a look at the `./INSTALL` file.

Usage
=====
DisnixOS supports various deployment operations.

Deploying infrastructure
------------------------
In order to deploy infrastructure (i.e. a network of NixOS machines), one must
create on or more NixOS network models that define a network of NixOS
configurations.

By running the following command-line instruction with at least one network model
as a parameter, the system configuration will be deployed through Disnix:

```bash
$ disnixos-deploy-network network.nix
```

Deploying services and infrastructure at the same time
------------------------------------------------------
Besides infrastructure only, we can also deploy services and infrastructure at
the same time. For example:

```bash
$ disnixos-env -s services.nix -n network.nix -d distribution.nix
```

The above command-line instruction first deploys the infrastructure and then
the services using Disnix. The infrastructure model is generated automatically
from the NixOS network model.

Deploying services and infrastructure in a network of QEMU VMs
--------------------------------------------------------------
We can also spawn a network of efficiently instantiated QEMU VMs in which a
service-oriented system is deployed through Disnix:

```bash
$ disnixos-vm-env -s services.nix -n network.nix -d distribution.nix
```

The above command uses NixOS' test driver to quickly set up VMs and is
paricularly useful to quickly test a deployment.

Deploying infrastructure through NixOps and services through Disnix
------------------------------------------------------------------
We can also use NixOps to instantiate and deploy infrastructure, and use
Disnix to deploy the services to the corresponding VM instances.

The following command instantiates and deploys a network of VirtualBox machines:

```bash
$ nixops create ./network.nix ./network-virtualbox.nix -d test
$ nixops deploy -d test
```

The following environment variable specifies that we want to deploy in a network
called `test` that is deployed by NixOps:

```bash
$ export NIXOPS_DEPLOYMENT=test
```

The following command deploys the services into the network deployed by NixOps:

```bash
$ disnixos-env -s services.nix -n network.nix -n network-virtualbox.nix -d distribution.nix --use-nixops
```

Automated testing of Disnix deployments
---------------------------------------
Another feature of this package are function abstractions that can be used to
non-interactively test a Disnix deployment from within a Nix build for testing
purposes. Consult the manual for more details on this.

Manual
======
DisnixOS has a nice Docbook manual that can be compiled yourself. However, it is
also available [online](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/disnix/disnixos-trunk/tarball/latest/download-by-type/doc/manual).
