The command \`disnixos-restore-network' is used to restore the state of all
mutable components that have been deployed as part of machine's configuration.

Options:
      --target-property=PROP          The target property of an infrastructure
                                      model, that specifies how to
                                      connect to the remote Disnix interface.
                                      (Defaults to hostname)
      --interface=INTERFACE           Process that communicates with the remote
                                      disnix service. Defaults to:
                                      disnix-ssh-client
      --transfer-only                 Transfers the snapshot from the target
                                      machines, but does not actually restore
                                      them
      --all                           Transfers all snapshot generations of the
                                      target machines, not the latest
  -p, --profile=PROFILE               Name of the profile that is used for this
                                      system. Defaults to: default
  -m, --max-concurrent-transfers=NUM  Maximum amount of concurrent closure
                                      transfers. Defauls to: 2
      --disable-disnix                Do not enable the Disnix service on the
                                      target machines by default
      --show-trace                    Shows a trace of the output
  -h, --help                          Shows the usage of this command
  -v, --version                       Shows the version of this command

Environment:
  DISNIX_CLIENT_INTERFACE    Sets the client interface (which defaults to
                             \`disnix-ssh-client')
  DISNIX_TARGET_PROPERTY     Specifies which property in the infrastructure Nix
                             expression specifies how to connect to the remote
                             interface (defaults to: hostname)
  DISNIX_PROFILE             Sets the name of the profile that stores the
                             manifest on the coordinator machine and the
                             deployed services per machine on each target
                             (Defaults to: default).
