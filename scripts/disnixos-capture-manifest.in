Usage: $me [OPTION] network_nix [ network2_nix ... ]

The command \`disnixos-capture-manifests' consults the manifests of the target
Disnix profiles, retrieves their intra-dependency closures and composes a Nix
expression that can be used to reconstruct the deployment manifest on the
coordinator machine.

Options:
  -p, --profile=PROFILE       Name of the profile in which the services are
                              registered. Defaults to: default
      --interface=INTERFACE   Path to executable that communicates with a Disnix
                              interface. Defaults to \`disnix-ssh-client'
      --target-property=PROP  The target property of an infrastructure model,
                              that specifies how to connect to the remote Disnix
                              interface. (Defaults to hostname)
  -m, --max-concurrent-transfers=NUM
                              Maximum amount of concurrent closure transfers.
                              Defauls to: 2
      --use-nixops            Use NixOps instead of Disnix for infrastructure
                              deployment
  -h, --help                  Shows the usage of this command to the user
  -v, --version               Shows the version of this command to the user

Environment:
  DISNIX_CLIENT_INTERFACE    Sets the client interface (which defaults to
                             \`disnix-ssh-client'
  DISNIX_TARGET_PROPERTY     Specifies which property in the infrastructure Nix
                             expression specifies how to connect to the remote
                             interface (defaults to: hostname)
  DISNIX_PROFILE             Sets the name of the profile that stores the
                             manifest on the coordinator machine and the
                             deployed services per machine on each target
                             (Defaults to: default)
